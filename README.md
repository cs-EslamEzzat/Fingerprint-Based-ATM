# Fingerprint-Based-ATM
An implementaion of Fingerprint-Based-ATM, It allows users to authenticate with ATM using fingerprint instead of card.

# Problem Definition
- The first scenario, when anyone want to deal with ATM this require card but if the person isn’t having the card or lost the card he doesn’t deal with ATM.
- The second scenario, Traditional ATM System accept only the pin code as a security system, enabling the other person rather than the owner to access the account very easily.

# Problem Solution
- The proposed system provides the solution for users that’s `Fingerprint-Based-ATM`.

# Features
1. Fingerprint-Based-ATM System is more secure than ATM card.
2. Strength the security of the system.
3. The user can authenticate with ATM without having card.
4. Easy to use.
5. The system provides fingerprint and pin code as a security system instead of using pin code only.
6. Using fingerprint, it contributes to development process of banking.
7. Saving time.

# Tools
- Fingerprint sensor.
- Arduino UNO.
- Jumper Wires.
- Pin Header Male.
- C#.
- SQL.
